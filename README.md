This is an example of how you can use HA proxy to conditionally route traffic to different versions of an application. This is especially useful when conducting A/B testing, canary testing or blue/green deployments. There is also a management interface which is quite rough at the moment, I will tidy this up in the coming months (because I am talking about it at a conference in Q1 2019.)
